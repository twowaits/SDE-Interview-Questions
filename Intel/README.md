<b name="coding">Coding round questions</b><br/>
-  Design a stack in which we should push and pop at both the ends (30 min)
Solve the same using Linked List and Arrays.
Write test case to verify your code.
- Design autonomous driving car. (30 min)
They were checking how deep we can think and consider all the possible use cases and scenarios
- A simple code on brute force approach, Given a hotel check-in and checkOut list(of a month) containing a number of persons check-in and checkOut on each and every day, find out the days which has maximum check-in and maximum CheckOut?
- Design a stack with push pop and find min operations in o(1) time.
- Explain external merge sorting. And try to optimize it if possible.
- Given a string s1 and another string s2, what is the smallest substring in s1 that contains all the characters of s2 ? (most efficient solution)
