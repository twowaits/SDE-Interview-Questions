##Zoho Interview Coding Questions
###For freshers, they mostly ask programming questions based on an array, string, and Linked lists.

##Coding Question 1: Based on String
Input: a1b2c3
Output: abbccc
Caution: Don't use inbuilt functions
Explanation:

After we have the number 1 so a repeats one time = a
After b we have the number 2 so it repeats two times = bb
After c we have the number 3 so it repeats three times = ccc
Final Output: abbccc

###Algorithm:

1. Start the Program
2. Get the input as a single string
3. Loop through the entire string to find the numbers
4. After finding the number, Repeat the previous character the same number of times
5. For example a4 ( So you find the number 4 and print a 4 times)
6. Follow the steps 3,4 for the entire string
7. End the Program

###C Program
Prerequisite:
basic data types in C
loop statement in C

###Code:

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
  char str[100]="a1b2c4";
  int len=0;
  while(str[length]!='\0')
    len++;
  for(int i=0; i<len; i++)
  {
    if(str[i]>'0' &amp;&amp; str[i]<'9')
    {
      int num=str[i]-'0';
      for(int j=0; j<num; j++)
      {
        printf("%c", str[i-1]);
      }
    }
  }
}

###Output:

abbcccc
Python Program
If you know the Python basic syntax, you can implement the same program in Python in very few lines of code. That’s the beauty of Python programming.

Prerequisite:
range() function in Python
Python for-loop

##Code:

msg="a1b2c4"
out = ""
 
for ind in range(0, len(msg), 2):
  out += (msg[ind] * int(msg[ind+1]))
 
print(out)

###Output:
abbcccc


##Coding Question 2: Based on the Array
Input: [2,1,0,-8,-9]
Output: 0.4 , 0.2 , 0.4

###Explanation:
First, find the total number of elements in the array = 5
Find the total number of positive numbers=2
Find the total number of neutral numbers=1
(0 is the only neutral number)
Find the total number of negative numbers=2
Output = [ (no of positive number/length of array), (no of neutral numbers/length of array), (no of negative numbers/length of array) ]
=[⅖, ⅕, ⅖]
=[0.4, 0.2, 0.4]

Algorithm:
Start the Program
Get the input as an array
Find the length of the array
Find the number of positive, neutral, and negative numbers
Divide each one of the above results with the length of the array and print the output as an array( Make sure you print the output in float format and use 0.1f for one precision)
Stop the program
##C Program
Here we are using sizeof() operator.

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
  int a[]={1,2,4,-8,-1,0};
 
  int n=sizeof(a)/sizeof(int);
  int np, nz, nn;
  for(int i=0; i<n; i++)
  {
    if(a[i]>0)
    {
      np++;
    }
    else if(a[i]<0)
    {
      ne --;
    }
    else
    {
      nz++;
    }
  }
  printf("%0.1f , %0.1f , %0.1f ", np/n, nz/n, nn/n);
  return 0;
}

###Output:
0.6 , 0.2, 0.4

##Python Program
Let’s solve the same question in Python programming.

list_data =  [2,1,0,-8,-9]
 
count_positive = 0
count_neutral = 0
count_negative = 0
length_arr = len(list_data)
 
for val in list_data:
  if val>0:
    count_positive += 1
  elif val<0:
    count_negative += 1
    else:
      count_neutral += 1
 
print(
  count_positive/length_arr, 
  count_neutral/length_arr, 
  count_negative/length_arr
)

###Output:
0.4 0.2 0.4
There can be multiple types of coding questions asked based on the string, array. If you get the basics, you can solve these coding challenges in C/C++, Java, Python, or any programming languages of your choice.
